Enhances the use of page hierarchies by providing easy access to the parent page, sibling pages, and child pages in your admin area.

== Description ==

Managing pages in WordPress quickly becomes burdensome as your website grows. This is because the default Pages directory makes the common task of finding pages an intimidating challenge. When finally editing pages, you also cannot quickly get to a related page, so you have to head back to the extensive listing. As a result, much time that should be spent on content creation goes to waste.

**What about content organizer plugins?** Surprisingly, the same amount of energy and time can still be wasted. Instead of spending time searching for pages, you are now tasked with keeping content properly organized and designing appropriate folder structures. You might _also_ even need to train your team on your site’s organization standards so that it doesn’t get disorganized all over again!

Grouped Content, on the other hand, helps you manage your pages naturally and automatically. **All it takes is the simple action of setting a parent page.** _(Which you should already be doing!)_

= Enhanced Page Management =
With Grouped Content, you’ll be able to access pages faster, quickly generate new draft pages in bulk, and better visualize your site’s hierarchy.

= Features =
Grouped Content is light and simple with a few powerful features. For this reason, you don’t need to commit to reading an entire knowledge base or hire an expensive tech expert. You can get started immediately all while keeping control of your site’s pages with these main features:
* **Groups Admin Page** - View hierarchical pages in an easy-to-navigate, distraction-free area.
* **Page Relatives Metabox** - Access parent, sibling, and child pages immediately upon setting a parent page.
* **Content Generator** - Quickly add new draft pages and automate menu creation to efficiently create new groups of content for your site.

= Developer Friendly Code =
Grouped Content is built open-source and fully documented so that your developers can quickly build Grouped Content into exactly what you need it to be. To make customization even easier, plenty of hooks are also made available to developers. This means that customizations can be quickly added and easily maintained as new versions of Grouped Content are released.

== Installation ==

Grouped Content does not require any configurations after being activated. If you have already been making use of page hierarchies, Grouped Content will automatically enhance your experience maintaining page structures. Grouped Content makes use of WordPress’s native page hierarchies system rather than cluttering your database with additional data. It is extremely lightweight. Here are the features you should notice upon proper installation and activation:

= The Groups Screen =
After installing and activating Grouped Content on your WordPress website, you’ll see a new admin page in your lefthand menu titled Groups. It should be right below Pages. This is where you’ll be able to instantly see any page hierarchies that you’ve established. If you have not set any Parent Pages, then this will be empty until you do.

= The Page Relatives Metabox =
Another noticeable feature that’s been added to your admin area is the Page Relatives metabox. It is available in the righthand sidebar when editing a Page. If the page currently being edited has been assigned a Parent Page or the page has been assigned as the Parent Page on other pages, the Page Relatives box will display links to the related content where you can readily access them.

**If you are unsure of proper functioning or installation of Grouped Content, please review the screenshots listed at the bottom of the plugin’s Details section. If you are still experiencing issues, please do not hesitate to submit to the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/grouped-content/).**

*This plugin is multisite compatible and may be activated per site or network activated for all sites. There is no difference in functionality between the different activation methods.*

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I request a feature? =

Absolutely! Feedback and feature requests are strongly encouraged.

Please email [hello@purpleturtlecreative.com](mailto:hello@purpleturtlecreative.com). It helps a lot if you describe your problem and how you see Grouped Content improving your situation.

= Why don’t I see anything in Groups? =

Groups are formed when you assign a Parent Page to a page. When editing a page, you may assign a Parent Page in the Page Attributes section on the righthand side of your edit screen.

If you can’t find this box and are using Classic view (non-Gutenberg), it may be hidden. To show the Page Attributes metabox, click Screen Options at the top of the edit screen and then tick the checkbox to show Page Attributes.

= Why can’t I find the Page Relatives metabox? =

If you’re using Classic view (non-Gutenberg), it may be hidden.

If the Page Relatives metabox is not listed on the righthand side when editing a page, be sure to check your Screen Options if you’re using Classic view (non-Gutenberg). Click the Screen Options tab at the top of the page edit screen and then tick the checkbox to show Page Relatives.

= Where can I find documentation for this plugin? =

Tutorials and developer documentation for Grouped Content are currently being prepared on the new Purple Turtle Creative website. In the meantime, please post any questions you may have in the [plugin support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/grouped-content/). I'm happy to help!
